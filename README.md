# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process that involves creating simplified visual guides for digital products. It focuses on layout and structure without detailing final visual design elements. Wireframes help teams visualize user interactions early in the design process, saving time and reducing misunderstandings before development begins.


## Key Elements of Wireframing

- **Layout Structure**: Defines the skeletal arrangement of the UI. Example: Placement of headers, footers, and sidebars in a dashboard.
- **Navigation**: Shows how users move through the interface. Example: Top navigation bars or hamburger menus for mobile.
- **Content Placement**: Determines where key content like text, images, or buttons appear. Example: Call-to-action buttons near hero sections.
- **Functionality**: Outlines intended interactive elements like dropdowns or search fields. Example: Login forms with placeholder text and submit buttons.


## Types of Wireframes

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**: Basic sketches or block diagrams to represent layout ideas. Used in early design discussions.
- **High-Fidelity Wireframes**: Detailed designs with real content, close to the final look. Used for design handoff and testing.

### Example Type: High-Fidelity

The image used in this repository is High-Fidelity since it includes detailed designs with real content that is close to the original content.


## Wireframing Tools

Popular tools include:
- **Figma**: Cloud-based and collaborative, ideal for both low and high-fidelity wireframes. Features include real-time editing, prototyping, and design system integration.
- Balsamiq
- Adobe XD
- Sketch

### Unique Figma Use Case 

A nonprofit mental health organization used Figma to prototype a mobile app for teens that anonymously connects them to therapists via chat. Wireframing with Figma helped them identify that the original navigation layout was confusing, so they simplified it to a 3-tab system. This change increased engagement by 50% in usability tests and helped secure funding from donors.


## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development

- Clarifies project requirements early on
- Serves as a communication bridge between designers, developers, and stakeholders
- Reduces design iterations by identifying usability issues before coding
- Helps in estimating development time and costs more accurately

## Wireframing in Practice

A mobile e-commerce team planned to include a "wishlist" feature in their app but missed placing it prominently in the initial wireframe. During user testing of the wireframes, feedback showed that the wishlist was rarely noticed or used.

By repositioning it near the product image in the mobile app during the wireframing review, user interaction significantly increased.

Wireframing helped them identify this usability issue early, avoiding costly post-development changes. This highlighted how critical wireframes are in ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive mobile experience.
